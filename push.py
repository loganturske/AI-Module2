# This module implements the basic functionality for a nxn game of Push.
# The style is functional as much as Python allows and uses basic patterns
# common in Elixir:
#   1. there is no internal state.
#   2. data structures and actions are supplied and a modified copy is returned.
#
# This file only implements the *board* of Push. A  *game* of Push requires 
# keeping track of who's turn it is, checking for winners, and supplying a "brain"
# for the opponent.
#
# Additionally, you must check for cycles (repeating board states).
#
# Supplying the "brain" is the point of Module 2.
